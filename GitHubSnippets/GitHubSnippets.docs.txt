This adds a button to the template & partial view editor allowing you to insert Razor snippets from a GitHub Repo.

By default it fetches the snippets from a community GitHub Snippet repo, but you can easily change the repository to one of your own if you wish.

By default it uses this repo:
https://github.com/warrenbuckley/Umbraco-Snippets

The two settings are the GitHub Repository Username and the GitHub Repository Name, so this builds up a request to
https://github.com/warrenbuckley/Umbraco-Snippets
